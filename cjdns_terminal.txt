Sure, here are the steps for installing CJDNS on macOS:

Install Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, by running the following command in your terminal:
bash
Copy code
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Install the dependencies required for CJDNS by running the following command:
Copy code
brew install nodejs libsodium
Download the latest release of CJDNS from its GitHub repository. You can do this by navigating to the releases page (https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/releases) and downloading the appropriate binary for your macOS version.

Extract the downloaded archive by running the following command:

Copy code
tar -xvf cjdns-x.y.z.tar.gz
Navigate to the extracted directory by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
cd cjdns-x.y.z
Start CJDNS by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
./cjdroute
Note: By default, CJDNS will not run as a daemon, so it will continue running in the foreground. If you want to run it in the background, you can append the '&' character to the end of the command, like this:

bash
Copy code
./cjdroute &
This will start CJDNS in the background and return you to the command prompt.

That's it! CJDNS should now be installed and running on your macOS system.
