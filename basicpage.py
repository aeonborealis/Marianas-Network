Here's a basic Python script that creates a simple webpage:

Copy code
# Import the necessary libraries
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

# Define the HTTP request handler
class RequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        # Send a response
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
        self.end_headers()

        # Write the HTML content
        content = "<html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>"
        self.wfile.write(bytes(content, "utf8"))
        return

# Create the web server
server_address = ('127.0.0.1', 8080)
httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandler)

# Start the web server
httpd.serve_forever()

# This script creates a simple web server 
# using the HTTPServer class from the http.server module. 
# It defines a custom request handler class, RequestHandler,
# that inherits from BaseHTTPRequestHandler.

# The do_GET method of the RequestHandler class is called every time
# a GET request is made to the server. In this method, the server sends a response with a 
# 200 OK status code, and sets the content-type header to "text/html". 
# Then it sends the simple HTML content "Hello World!"

# The server is created with the address 127.0.0.1 and the port 8080,
# and it will keep running and serving the webpage until the script is stopped.
# You can visit the webpage by opening http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a browser.
